# Overview

This project was created as a take home challenge from a company that rejected me 2 minutes after submitting it. It now lives on my GitHub because I think it's a tight piece of code that showcases some of my skills. ;) It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built on React with TypeScript along with OpenWeather API and Mapbox API. Also fully responsive, and has custom hooks and error handling.
