# Overview

This project was created as a take home challenge from a company that rejected me 2 minutes after submitting it. It now lives on my GitHub because I think it's a tight piece of code that showcases some of my skills. ;) It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built on React with TypeScript along with OpenWeather API and Mapbox API.

## To run this project

-   Clone the repository
-   `yarn install` to get all of the required packages
-   Grab yourself some API keys from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/)
-   `yarn start` and you should be up and running.
